      <b>Did you know...</b> It&apos;s commonly thought that <span className="bolder-text">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</span>, directed by Hayao Miyazaki and based on his manga, was produced by Studio Ghibli. It was released in 1984, but Studio Ghibli formed in 1985 and its first film, <span className="bolder-text">Laputa: Castle in the Sky</span>, was released in 1986. However, many of those who worked on Nausicaä went on to form Studio Ghibli and it was Miyazaki&apos;s first of many collaborations with composer Joe Hisaishi. Despite not being producted by Studio Ghibli, it is typically considered part of the canon.
