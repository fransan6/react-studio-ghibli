ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¯ **Lesson(s)**: the importance of where to implement `useState` - finding where it needs to be used (`SearchBar` and `ProductTable`) and its common parent (`FilterableTable`). From `FilterableTable`, it's easy to pass down the current state and set function of `useState`. Also, learning to focus on breaking down the UI into components, sorted hierarchically, and thinking how to build in React going forward (prefer bottom-top to top-bottom).
