Using the brief from **React.dev** '*Thinking in React*' documentation ([link](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)) but not the code, so as to help me in React.

Started after **React.dev** the Tic-Tac-Toe challenge ([GitHub link](https://github.com/fransan6/react-challenges/tree/main/01-reactdev-tictactoe) but labelled as 00 due to its comparative simplicity.
